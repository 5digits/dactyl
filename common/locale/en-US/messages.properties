	Hallo. It looks like you've run into a problem resulting from       \
	overzealous optimizations by the JavaScript engine. We've disabled  \
	future use of these optimizations, but you'll need to restart your  \
	browser in order to correct the problems they've caused. You can    \
	re-enable them by resetting the javascript.options.methodjit.chrome \
