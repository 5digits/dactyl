<h1 tag="repeating">Repeating commands</h1>
<toc start="2"/>

<p>
    &dactyl.appName; can repeat commands in a number of ways, from repeating
    the last command, to recording and playing macros, to saving its state and
    executing scripts.
</p>

            Repeat the last keyboard mapping <oa>count</oa> times. Note that,
            unlike in Vim, this does not apply solely to editing commands,
            mainly because &dactyl.appName; doesn't have them.

            Record a key sequence as a macro. Available macros are
            <a>0-9a-zA-Z</a>. If the macro is an uppercase letter, the
            recorded keys are appended to the lowercase macro of the same
            name. Typing <k>q</k> again stops the recording.

<h2 tag="macro-utilities">Macro utilities</h2>

<p>
    The following key bindings facilitate the recording of efficient
    macros. They have no effect when typed normally, but are
    recorded and take effect during macro playback.

    <tags>:so :source</tags>
    <spec>:so<oa>urce</oa><oa>!</oa> <a>file</a></spec>
    <description>
        <p>
            Read Ex commands, JavaScript, or CSS from <a>file</a>. Files are
            interpreted based on their extensions. Files which end in
            <em>.js</em> are executed as JavaScript, while those ending in
            <em>.css</em> are loaded as Cascading Stylesheets, and anything
            else is interpreted as Ex commands. In normal cases, any errors
            generated by the execution or non-existence of <a>file</a> are
            printed to the <t>command-line</t> area.  When <oa>!</oa> is
            provided, these are suppressed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Environment variables in <a>file</a> are expanded to their current
            value, and the prefix <em>~</em> is replaced with the value of
            <em>$HOME</em>. See <t>expand-env</t> and <t>initialization</t>
            for more information.
        </p>

        <h3 tag=":source-css">Cascading Stylesheets</h3>

        <p>
            When a CSS file is sourced, its contents are applied to every web
            page and every chrome document, including all browser windows and
            dialogs. If the same file is sourced more than once, its previous
            rules are cleared before it is applied again. Rules can be
            restricted to specific documents by enclosing them in
            <link topic="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/@-moz-document">@-moz-document</link>
            blocks.
        </p>

        <h3 tag=":source-javascript">JavaScript</h3>

        <p>
            JavaScript files are executed with full chrome privileges in their
            own global namespaces. These namespaces are stored as objects in
            the <em>plugins</em> object, in the property named after the full
            path of the sourced file. This means that any variables or
            functions created by your script are stored as properties of that
            object. Additionally, all properties of the global <em>window</em>
            and <em>modules</em> objects are accessible to your script as
            global variables.
        </p>

        <p>
            Files in <em>~/.&dactyl.name;/plugins</em> may additionally be
            accessed in <em>plugins.<a>filename</a></em> where <a>filename</a>
            is the last component of the file's path stripped of any
            extensions, with all hyphens stripped and any letter following a
            hyphen capitalized.  So, the file
            <em>~/.&dactyl.name;/plugins/foo-bar.js</em> may be accessed as
            <em>plugins.fooBar</em>. See also <t>writing-plugins</t>.
        </p>

        <h3 tag=":source-ex">Ex commands</h3>

        <p>
            Ex command files are executed as if each line were entered into
            the &tag.command-line; individually.
            Additionally, certain commands support the same ‘here document’
            syntax supported by most Unix shells and by the &tag.command-line;.
            So, to execute a JavaScript statement which does not comfortably fit
            on a single line, you can use:
        </p>

        <code><ex>:js</ex> &lt;&lt;<em>EOF</em>
<kwd><hl key="Object">var</hl></kwd> hello = <kwd>function</kwd> () {
    alert(<str>Hello world</str>);
}
<em>EOF</em></code>

    <spec>:loadplugins <oa>pattern</oa> …</spec>
    <description>
        <p>
            Immediately load all plugins which have yet to be loaded. Because
            plugins are not automatically loaded until after <tt><t>&dactyl.name;rc</t></tt>
            is sourced, this command must be placed early in the
            <tt>&dactyl.name;rc</tt> file if <tt>&dactyl.name;rc</tt> uses commands or options
            which are defined by plugins. Additionally, this command allows
            newly installed plugins to be easily loaded without restarting
            &dactyl.appName;. See also <o>loadplugins</o>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If <oa>pattern</oa>s are provided, the given regular expressions are
            used as filters rather than those in <o>loadplugins</o>.

<h3 tag="ex-scripts">Ex Command Scripts</h3>

<p>
    Ex command scripts are similar to both entering commands on the
    &tag.command-line; and to Vim
    scripts, but with some notable differences.
</p>

<p tag="multiline-commands">
    Commands in Ex command scripts can span multiple lines by
    prefixing the second and further lines with a <em>\</em>
    character. For instance, the following all define commands whose
    definitions span multiple lines.
</p>

<code><ex>:command!</ex> <str delim="">foo</str>
        \ <em>-description</em> <str>A command that frobs bars</str>
        \ <ex>:javascript</ex> frob(content.bar)</code>

<code><ex>:style</ex> <em>-name</em> <str delim="'">foo</str>
     \ <str delim="'">foobar.com</str>
     \ p<str delim="">:first-line</str> { <em>font-variant</em>: <str delim="">small-caps</str>; }
     \ div<em>#side-bar</em> > <str delim="">:first-child</str> { <em>display</em>: <str delim="">none</str>; }</code>

<code><ex>:command!</ex> <str delim="">do-some-stuff</str>
        \ <em>-description</em> <str>A command which does some stuff in JavaScript</str>
        \ <ex>:javascript</ex> &lt;&lt;<em>EOF</em>
        \     window.do(<str>some</str>);
        \     window.do(<str>stuff</str>);
        \<em>EOF</em></code>

<code><ex>:command!</ex> <str delim="">do-some-stuff</str>
        \ <em>-description</em> <str>A command which does some stuff in JavaScript</str>
        \ <ex>:javascript</ex>
        \\    window.do(<str>some</str>);
        \\    window.do(<str>stuff</str>);</code>

<p tag="comments">
    Lines may be commented out by prefixing them with a <em>"</em>
    character.
</p>

<code>            <hl style="color: #444">" This is a comment</hl>
    foo bar <hl style="color: #444">" This is a comment</hl>
            <str> This is not a comment</str>
    foo bar <str> This is not a comment</str>
</code>

        <p>
            Profile a piece of JavaScript code or an Ex command. Run
            <a>code</a> <oa>count</oa> times and print the elapsed time.
            If <a>code</a> begins with a <ex>:</ex>, it is executed as an Ex
            command. Otherwise, it is executed as JavaScript, in which case it
            is evaluated only once and stored as a function which is executed
            <oa>count</oa> times.
        </p>

        <p>
            When <oa>!</oa> is given, <a>code</a> is executed <oa>count</oa>
            times, but no statistics are printed.
