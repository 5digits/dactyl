# Shared Modules #

Many common elements are referenced across the Mozmill tests. To make it easier
to work with these elements and execute common actions, shared modules have been
implemented. These modules contain helper classes and helper functions with a
focus on user interface. Some of these shared modules are unique to Firefox,
while others can also be used in other applications based on the Gecko platform.
