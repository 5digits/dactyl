Priority list:
1-9 as in Vim (9 = required for next release, 5 = would be nice, 1 = probably not)

BUGS:
- broken commands:
  - :tabduplicate
  - :open songbird-internal-search searchString (broken because SB intercepts queries to this engine)
  - <C-^> only works between browser tabs not the media tab
  - numbered tabs
