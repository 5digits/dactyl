        execute only for certain websites.
      - Autocommands, commands, mappings, and styles are now
        automatically added to per-script groups so that most traces

        the completion list in increments larger than one line. [b8]
      - Improved handling of asynchronous completions, including: [b8]
        + Pressing <Return> after tabbing past the end of already received
          completions will execute the command after the desired result has
          arrived.
        + Tabbing past the end of available completions more reliably selects
          the desired completion when it is available.
        + Late arriving completion results no longer interfere with typing.

          groups via the c_<C-f> and c_<C-Tab> keys.
