    * IMPORTANT: Pentadactyl's licence has changed from the MPL/GPL/LGPL
      tri-license to the MIT license.
    * IMPORTANT: Map.flags has been replaced with individual properties.
      Mappings defined in plugins with mappings.add will need to be updated.
...................................
      E.g.
          mappings.add(...,
              { flags: Mappings.flags.ARGUMENT |
                       Mappings.flags.COUNT |
                       Mappings.flags.MOTION |
                       Mappings.flags.ALLOW_EVENT_ROUTING });
      is now
	   mappings.add(...,
               { arg: true, count: true, motion: true, route: true });
...................................
    * IMPORTANT: shifted key notation now matches Vim's behaviour. E.g. <C-a>
      and <C-A> are equivalent, to map the uppercase character use <C-S-A>.
    * IMPORTANT: 'popups' now takes a stringlist rather than a number.

    * add [c]:winonly[c]

    * make [c]:open[c] behavior match that of [c]:tabopen[c] and [c]:winopen[c]
      when no argument is specified
    * add extension related commands - [c]:extadd[c], [c]:extdelete[c],
      [c]:extdisable[c], [c]:extenable[c], [c]:extensions[c], [c]:extoptions[c]
    * add *-javascript* flag to [c]:autocommand[c]
    * add 'private' - enter private browsing mode, matching *PrivateMode*

    * command-line options are now supported via the host application's
      *-dactyl* option

    * massively speed up [c]:open[c] completions
    * TabMixPlus (and other tab extensions) should work much better now
      together with Pentadactyl unless you [c]:set guioptions+=[nN][c]
    * remove 'preload' option. You can fake it by some custom JavaScript in your RC file.
    * add [c]:frameonly[c]
    * add [c]:stopall[c]
    * add [c]:tabdo[c]
    * add 'encoding'

      [m]o[m]/[m]O[m] and [m]t[m]/[m]T[m]
    * add [c]:messclear[c]
    * add 'maxitems'
    * as usual many small bug fixes

2009-03-28:
    * version 2.0
    * IMPORTANT: For compatibility with Vim, the 'guioptions' "b" value has been renamed
      "B". "b" now represents the bottom scrollbar.
    * IMPORTANT: [c]:set[c] now sets multiple options, as in Vim. Spaces in values
      must be quoted or escaped.
    * IMPORTANT: Due to much improved autocompletion, changed default 'complete' option
      value to "sfl", listing intelligent Firefox location bar results. Using "b" or "h"
      might cause problems/massive slowdowns, use with care!
    * IMPORTANT: AlwaysHint mode with [m];F[m] mode changed the semantics slightly.
    * IMPORTANT: command actions now take an args object, returned from
      commands.parseArgs, as their first argument. This will break any commands
      not using the args parser explicitly.  The old string value is now
      available via args.string.
    * IMPORTANT: 'verbose' is now used for message levels. Logging is
      controlled by the *extensions.dactyl.loglevel* preference.
    * IMPORTANT: [c]:viusage[c] and [c]:exusage[c] now jump to the help index, use the
      special versions for the old behavior.
    * IMPORTANT: renamed Startup and Quit autocmd events to *PentadactylEnter* and
      *PentadactylLeave* respectively.
    * IMPORTANT: 'verbose' is now by default at 1, set to 0 to not show any status messages.
    * IMPORTANT: $PENTADACTYL_HOME is no longer used.

    * Selecting an <input type="file"> with hints now causes the command line to prompt
      for file input (instead of doing nothing).
    * [count][m]<C-n>[m] now goes to the [count]th next tab rather than the [count]th tab.
    * add ~/.pentadactyl/info/{profile}/, similar to viminfo
    * add [j]$PENTADACTYL_RUNTIME[j], [j]$PENTADACTYL_INIT[j]
    * [c]:hardcopy[c] now supports output redirection to a file on Unix and MacUnix
    * add [m];f[m] extended hint mode to focus a frame
    * add "r", "l", and "b" to 'guioptions' to toggle the scrollbars.
    * remove spaces and newlines when open urls starting with http:// or similar
      before :o http://linux .com would search for http://linux and for .com, now
      it just opens linux.com. Also handy when pasting broken urls with [m]p[m] or [m]P[m].
    * add 'wildcase' option
    * 'linkbgcolor', 'linkfgcolor', ... have been replaced with highlight
      groups, *HintElem* and *HintActive*
    * new 'followhints' option

    * add [c]:loadplugins[c] command
    * add [m].[m] mapping
    * add [m]N%[m] normal mode command
    * add interpolation for items such as *<url>* to autocommands
    * add *-nargs*, *-complete*, *-bang*, and *-count* attribute support to [c]:command[c]
    * much improved completion support, including javascript, option, and search keyword
    * add [m]<PageUp>[m]/[m]<S-Up>[m] and [m]<PageDown>[m]/[m]<S-Down>[m] command-line mappings for
      selecting the previous and next history items
    * remove 'hintstyle', 'hlsearchstyle', 't_vb' and 'visualbellstyle' - use
      [c]:highlight {Hint,Search,Bell}[c]
    * add [c]:highlight[c]
    * add [c]:optionusage[c]
    * add [c]:doautocmd[c] and [c]:doautoall[c]

    * add count support to [m]<C-^>[m] (Kazuo)
    * add 'eventignore' option
    * add [c]:tabdetach[c] command
    * new [m];b[m] extended hint mode (thanks Daniel Schaffrath)
    * [c]:qa![c] and [c]:q![c] quit forcefully, as in Vim
    * stop macro playback on [m]<C-c>[m]
    * [c]:bmark[c] now updates a bookmark, if possible. [c]:bmark![c] adds a new one
    * [c]:dialog[c] and [c]:sidebar[c] arguments are now case-insensitive
    * many bug fixes

2008-08-16:
    * version 1.2
    * IMPORTANT: changed [c]:command[c] to behave like Vim's version.
...................................
      Eg. An alert command specified previously as
          :command AlertMe alert(args)
      should now be defined as
          :command AlertMe :js alert(<args>)
...................................
    * IMPORTANT: changed (again) the default keybinding to temporarily disable all
      Pentadactyl keybindings from [m]<C-q>[m] to [m]<C-z>[m] since many users complained
      about hitting [m]<C-q>[m] twice and exiting Pentadactyl
    * IMPORTANT: removed old [c]:buffers![c] buffer window, as it was ugly and slightly broken
      use [m]B[m] or [c]:buffers[c] instead
    * IMPORTANT: input fields are not blured anymore by default after a page has loaded
      use [c]:set [no]focuscontent[c] to control the behavior (thanks Paul Sobey for the
      generous donation which made this behavior possible)
    * IMPORTANT: [m]<C-x>[m]/[m]<C-a>[m] never take possible negative URLs into account, it was just
      too unpredictable
    * performance fix by using cached history, should save about 5ms on each pageload
    * add [c]:emenu[c] for accessing the Firefox main menu items from the command line
    * add 'shell' and 'shellcmdflag' options
    * [c]:tabprevious[c], [c]:bprevious[c], [c]:tabnext[c], [c]:bnext[c] and friends now accept a prefix count
    * add [c]:comclear[c] and [c]:delcommand[c]
    * add a special version to [c]:hardcopy[c] to skip the Print dialog

    * support for *:%foo* as a count for commands (not yet widely used)
    * show informative message when a background tab was loaded, especially useful
      with a hidden tab bar.
    * new "l" flag for 'complete' to reuse the Firefox awesome bar for getting better
      completions for [c]:open[c]. Works only when 'wildoptions' contains "auto" and can
      be a little buggy if you are typing too fast.
    * new 'wildoptions' option (default off for now), to automatically list
      completions without the need to press the tab key
    * new argument parser for Ex commands, should tell better error messages when
      you do things like [c]:bmark -tag=a,b[c] instead of [c]:bmark -tags=a,b[c]
    * some option values can be tab-completed now; e.g., [c]:set wim=<tab>[c]
    * [c]:bdelete[c] accepts an optional argument now
    * renamed some [c]:autocmd[c], mainly BrowserStartup -> Startup and BrowserExit -> Quit
    * don't pass certain keys like [m]<C-o>[m] or [m]<C-n>[m] to Firefox in insert mode
    * keywords in [c]:open <arg>[c] have higher priority than local files now
    * add 'online' to control the "work offline" menu item
    * add [c]:jumps[c] command to list current tab's history
    * add [c]:setlocal[c] & [c]:setglobal[c] commands, so options can be local (per tab) & global
    * many small bug fixes

2008-06-03:
    * version 1.1
    * IMPORTANT: security update for suggest engines
    * try to add .exe automatically to filenames on windows, so [c]:set editor=gvim -f[c]
      will automatically invoke gvim.exe (if it's in the path). Thanks to
      Guido Van Hoecke
    * readded 'visualbellstyle' (thanks mauke)

      pressing tab (disabled by default). Also added new 'suggestengines' option.

    * [m]<C-t>[m] on input fields starts a very basic vi-mode
    * [c]:play[c] for playing a recorded macro
