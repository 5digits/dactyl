    * Extensive Firefox 4 support, including:
      - Tabs in :buffer completions and listings are grouped
        by panorama groups.
      - Only visible tabs are considered in tab numbering,
        gt/gn/gN, etc.

    * New and much more powerful incremental search implementation.
      Improvements over the standard Firefox find include:
      - Starts at the cursor position in the currently selected
        frame, unlike Firefox, which always starts at the start of
        the first frame.

        on cancel.
      - Backtracks to the first successful match after pressing

        prefixing the continuation lines with a \
      - The \ character is no longer treated specially within single
        quotes, i.e., 'fo\o''bar' â‡’ fo\o'bar
    * Command line is now hidden by default. Added c, C, and M to
      'guioptions'.
    * Hint mode improvements, including:
      - Added g; continued extended hint mode, which allows

        global object, including XMLHttpRequest and encodeURI.
    * The concept of completion contexts is now exposed to the user
      (see :h :contexts), allowing for powerful and fine-grained
      completion system customization.
    * IMPORTANT: Command script files now use the *.penta file extension.
    * IMPORTANT: Plugins are now loaded from the 'plugins/'
      directory in 'runtimepath' rather than 'plugin/'.
    * IMPORTANT: 'loadplugins' is now a regexlist option rather than
      a boolean.

      specially. Use "." instead.

      no longer be split at quoted commas and the option name,
      operators, and = sign may no longer be quoted. This will break
      certain automatically-generated configuration files.
