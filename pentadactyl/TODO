Priority list:
1-9 as in Vim (9 = required for next release, 5 = would be nice, 1 = probably not)

ARCHITECTURE:
- Host docs on the website - is there even a documentation tool that
  can parse our source sensibly?

- unify the disgusting hodge podge of contract specification styles

BUGS:
- ;s saves the page rather than the image
- RC file is sourced once per window

FEATURES:
9 <C-o>/<C-i> should work as in Vim (i.e., save page positions as well as
  locations in the history list).
9 clean up error message codes and document
9 option groups, including buffer-local and site-specific
8 wherever possible: get rid of dialogs and ask console-like dialog questions
  or write error prompts directly on the webpage or with :echo()
8 add search capability to MOW
8 registers
8 Document Caret and Visual modes.
8 replace global variables with plugin scoped user options
8 adaptive timeout for auto-completions, :set completions can be updated more often than
  :open foo
8 add support for filename special characters such as %
8 :redir and 'verbosefile'
8 middleclick in content == p, and if command line is open, paste there the clipboard buffer
8 all search commands should start searching from the top of the visible viewport
8 Add information to dactyl/HACKING file about testing and optimization
7 describe-key command (prompt for a key and display its binding with documentation)
7 Specify all INSERT mode mappings rather than falling through to the host apps
  mystery meat mappings.
7 use ctrl-n/p in insert mode for word completion
7 implement QuickFix window based on ItemList
7 [d could go to the last domain in the history stack. So if I browse from
  google to another page and click 10 links there, [d would take me back to the google page
  opera's fast forward does something like this
7 make an option to disable session saving by default when you close Firefox
7 :grep support (needs location list)
6 :mksession
6 add [count] support to :b* and :tab* commands where missing
6 check/correct spellings in insert mode with some mappings
6 add more autocommands (TabClose, TabOpen, TabChanged etc)
6 Use ctrl-w+j/k/w to switch between sidebar, content, preview window
6 ;?<hint> should show more information
5 when looking at a zoomed out image (because it's large), zi should zoom in
  maybe with this? : http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/content/html/document/public/nsIImageDocument.idl
3 A format for 'guitablabel' and 'statusline'
3 add a command-line window (:help cmdline-window in Vim).
3 Splitting Windows with [:sp :vsp ctrl-w,s ctrl-w,v] and closing with [ctrl-w,q], moving with [ctrl-w,w or tab]
  have a look into the split browser extension
