Priority list:
1-9 as in Vim (9 = required for next release, 5 = would be nice, 1 = probably not)

ARCHITECTURE:
- Host docs on the website - is there even a documentation tool that
  can parse our source sensibly?

- unify the disgusting hodge podge of contract specification styles

- ;s saves the page rather than the image
- RC file is sourced once per window
